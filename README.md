# Getting Started with CoreML (HotDog or Not App) üå≠

This project is the sample of my presentation from the First Applaudo Developer Conference. This application is an image classifier developed by using the Apple's CoreML Framework and using the [SqueezeNet](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/models/) model. This project is based on a Silicon Valley TV Show episode in which one of the characters develops an application which can classify food by telling you if a picture is a hotdog or not.

## Social Media
Feel free to reach me on any of my social media. If you have any doubt or you want to talk with me, I would be happy to help you. Also, I often share content mostly on my Instagram, and I'm preparing a couple of things for you to learn about CoreML and iOS in general.
